# Garage133

Garage133 is a DIY device for garage door automation.

It can open and close two garage doors via Wifi. It uses inexpensive sonar sensors to detect whether the doors are open or closed, and detect the presense of a car in each of two locations.  It integrates with Home Assistant via MQTT.

Please see the [blog post](https://selectiveappeal.org/posts/garage133/) about this project.

This repository contains KiCAD designs for the circuit board, OpenSCAD files for the project box for the device and for sonar mounts, and C++ code for the firmware.  This code can be built using PlatformIO.
